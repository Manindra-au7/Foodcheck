# Foodcheck
Front-end application that presents the user with a textbox where they can list
comma-separated items they usually eat for lunch. Once that's entered, the user has to click the
Check If Too Much button. The UI will respond with “Enjoy!” or “Careful“ or “Too much!”


If the number of items in the textbox is less than or equal to 3 (e.g., 1, 2, or 3), a message
should show up under to the textbox saying "Enjoy"
If the number of items is 4, the message should be “Careful”
If the number of items is 5 or above, the message should be "Too much"
If the textbox is empty and the user clicks the Check If Too Much button, the message
Please enter data first should show up.
